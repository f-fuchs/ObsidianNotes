# General

## Aim

Mimic cross-sections through the earth.

## Steps

1. Acquire Data
2. Place the required events in the correct location (Migration)
3. Process Data (remove unwanted energy, e. g. multiples)

## Glossary

CDP := common depth point  
Fold := number of traces with same CDP  
Full Fold := area with maximum amount of CDP  
Source Interval := distance/time between the source of the traces  
Receiver Interval := distance/time between the receivers  
Picket Interval := same as Receiver Interval?  
CDP Interval := Picket Interval / 2
