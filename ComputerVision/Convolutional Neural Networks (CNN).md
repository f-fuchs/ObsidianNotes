Convolutional neural networks comprise many [[Convolutional Layer]]s, stacked on top of the each other, in a sequence. The sequential architecture of CNNs allows them to learn hierarchical features. Every layer can recognize shapes, and the deeper the network goes, the more complex are the shapes which can be recognized. The design of convolutional layers in a CNN reflects the structure of the human visual cortex. In fact, our visual cortex is similarly made of different layers, which process an image in our sight by sequentially identifying more and more complex features.
