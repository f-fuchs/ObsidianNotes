# Fine-Tuning

## Full Fine-Tuning

Fine tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and training it further on a new dataset. This process adjusts all the weights of the model to better fit the new data.

## Partial Fine-Tuning

Partial fine tuning is similar to fine tuning, but instead of updating all the weights, only a subset of the model's layers are updated. Often, the earlier layers are frozen, and only the later layers are fine-tuned.
