# ConvNeXt

ConvNeXt are a modernized version of [[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)|ConvNets]] based on the improvements of hierarchical [[Vision Transformer]]s ([[Swin Transformer]]). The first mayor performance increase is a result of an increased training recipe, inspired by [[Swin Transformer]] and [[Data-Efficient Image Transformers (DeiT)]]. The  next performance increases where achieved by architectural changes and are as follows:
 - Changing the stage compute ratio  to 1:1:9:1 analog to [[Swin Transformer]]
