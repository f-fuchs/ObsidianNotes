The exploding gradient problem typically occurs when gradients are multiplied through many layers during backpropagation. In deep neural networks, especially those with many layers or complex architectures, gradients can accumulate and grow exponentially as they propagate backwards through the layers. This explosion in gradient size can cause weight updates to become too large, leading to erratic training behavior such as oscillation or divergence.

To mitigate the exploding gradient problem, several techniques can be employed:

1. **Gradient clipping**: Limiting the magnitude of gradients during training can prevent them from growing excessively. This technique involves scaling down gradients if they exceed a certain threshold.
2. **Weight regularization**: Adding regularization terms to the loss function, such as L2 regularization (weight decay), can help prevent weights from growing too large and contributing to exploding gradients.
