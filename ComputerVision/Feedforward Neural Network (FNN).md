## Multilayer Perceptron (**MLP**)

A **multilayer perceptron** (**MLP**) is a type of FNN, consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear kind of activation function, organized in at least three layers, notable for being able to distinguish data that is not [linearly separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_separability "Linear separability").[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network#cite_note-Cybenko1989-30)
